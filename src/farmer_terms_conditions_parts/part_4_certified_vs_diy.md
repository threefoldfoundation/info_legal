4. CERTIFIED VS. DIY-FARMERS

There are two types of ThreeFold Farmers:

    1. Certified Farmer: Uses hardware from certified sources and signs a contract with TF Tech NV for support and additional benefits; and

    2. Do It Yourself (DIY) Farmer: Uses any hardware and in case of support uses online material only.

Farmers can opt in for certification by ThreeFold ("**Certification**"). Certification can be withdrawn in case the relevant 3Node does no longer comply with the applicable certification requirements. 

The following criteria or requirements are checked (timing tbd, see roadmap on wiki):

* Bandwidth: 24 times a day random non local nodes are used to upload a 2MB file to a 3Node. The bandwidth will be measured in mbit/sec

* Utilization: Through the ThreeFold Explorer the true utilization of the 3Node will be checked. It will be displayed in % of the 3Node total capacity.

* Uptime: The uptime per month will be created in the ThreeFold Explorer and is presented as a percentage of 3Node availability.

ThreeFold may give free certification to 3Nodes that benefit the distribution of capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. ThreeFold may also certify certain hardware partners (i.e. certified hardware vendors). Whoever connects 3Node which are distributed and sourced from a certified hardware partner will not have to pay for the certification. The network uptime and capacity however will still be measured and has to adhere to the certification criteria.
